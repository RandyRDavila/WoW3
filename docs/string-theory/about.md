# About the String Theory Conjectures

This section of the site presents conjectures generated by the **TxGraffiti** system (in *Vibrations* mode) based on a structured dataset of **Complete Intersection Calabiâ€“Yau (CICY) threefolds**, a class of complex manifolds fundamental to string theory and algebraic geometry.

## ðŸŒŒ Dataset Description

The dataset was obtained from the [List of Complete Intersection Calabiâ€“Yau Three-Folds](https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/projects/CalabiYau/cicylist/), which contains **7890** Calabiâ€“Yau threefolds defined as complete intersections in products of projective spaces.

Each manifold is represented by a configuration matrix encoding the degrees of the defining polynomials over products of projective spaces.

## ðŸ“Š Invariants and Features

We compute both **numeric** and **Boolean** invariants from each configuration, including:

- \( h^{1,1} \), \( h^{2,1} \): Hodge numbers
- \( \chi = 2(h^{1,1} - h^{2,1}) \): Euler characteristic
- `moduli_density`: moduli fields per unit configuration size
- `num_ps`: number of projective space factors
- `codim`, `ambient_dim`, `matrix_rank`, `config_sum`, `num_nonzero`
- `is_mirror_symmetric`, `is_conifold_point`, `is_sparse_config`: Boolean properties

These quantities are treated as symbolic features for conjecture generation.

## ðŸ¤– Conjecturing Framework

The **TxGraffiti** engine was adapted to this geometric domain through a variant called **Vibrations**, which automatically generates inequalities and logical implications between invariants. Conjectures are filtered for:

- **Correctness** across the dataset
- **Sharpness** (bounds that are tight for some manifolds)
- **Symbolic simplicity** (e.g., low-degree polynomials)
- **Physical and geometric relevance**, especially regarding:
  - Mirror symmetry
  - Conifold transitions
  - Sparse embeddings
  - Dimensional scaling laws

## ðŸš§ Use and Interpretation

These conjectures are machine-generated and unproven. Some may correspond to known physical or mathematical truths; others may point toward novel structure within the landscape of Calabiâ€“Yau manifolds. We invite theoretical physicists and mathematicians to explore and rigorously test these ideas.
