# Prime-Residue Graph Conjectures

This page presents two conjectures relating the classical prime-counting function $\pi(n)$ to the structure of the **Fajtlowicz graph** $G_n$, defined as follows:

- Let $G_n$ be the graph with vertex set $\{2, 3, \dots, n\}$.
- An edge connects $u$ and $v$ if and only if $\gcd(u, v) \ne 1$.
- Let $R(G_n)$ denote the **Havel–Hakimi residue** of $G_n$.

Then $\pi(n)$ can be exactly expressed as:
$$
\pi(n) = R(G_n) + C(n),
$$
where $C(n)$ is a nonnegative integer-valued correction term.

## Conjecture 1: Structured Recursive Rule for $C(n)$

We define a recursive sequence of threshold values $(f(t))$ based on a rule:

- Start with $a_1 = 4$.
- For each integer $m \ge 1$, insert $m+3$ copies of 2 followed by a single value $m+4$.
- That is,
  $$
  a = [4,\ 2,\ 2,\ 2,\ 5,\ 2,\ 2,\ 2,\ 2,\ 6,\ 2,\dots]
  $$

Define:

$$
f(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{t} a_i.
$$

Then we conjecture:

$$
C(n) = \max \left\{ t \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \;\middle|\; \pi(n) \ge f(t) \right\}.
$$

This means that $C(n)$ increases each time the number of primes less than or equal to $n$ passes the next threshold in the sequence $f(t)$.

## Conjecture 2: Asymptotic Behavior

We further conjecture that:
$$
\pi(n) \sim R(G_n) + \log\log n \quad \text{as } n \to \infty.
$$

This suggests that the Havel–Hakimi residue $R(G_n)$ gives a graph-theoretic approximation to the prime-counting function, and the error term $C(n)$ grows like $\log\log n$.

## Interpretation

These conjectures offer a new decomposition of $\pi(n)$ into:

- A structured, computable **graph-theoretic component** $R(G_n)$,
- A slow-growing, **recursively defined arithmetic correction** $C(n)$.

This creates a novel connection between number theory and extremal graph theory, and suggests a new direction for understanding the distribution of primes through the lens of discrete structures.
