# About

**WoW3** (Written on the Wall III) is the official research site of Randy Davila and a public repository of conjectures generated by the automated reasoning system *TxGraffiti*.

These conjectures span graph theory, number theory, and emerging intersections with physics. Each statement is generated from structured datasets, guided by symbolic heuristics, and filtered for mathematical elegance, sharpness, or mystery. Many conjectures remain openâ€”each one an invitation to explore.

WoW3 continues the legacy of earlier systemsâ€”*Graffiti* (WoW I) and *Graffiti.pc* (WoW II)â€”by providing a modern platform for machine-generated insight. The project aims to deepen our understanding of what it means for machines to participate in mathematical discovery.
