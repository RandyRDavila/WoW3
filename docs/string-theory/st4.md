# Conjecture ST.4 — Sparsity Implies Lower Bound on Euler Density

**Statement.**
If the configuration matrix is sparse, then

$$
\chi_{\text{density}} \geq \frac{24}{5} \cdot \Big(1 - \frac{p \cdot a}{k}\Big) - \frac{16}{5},
$$

and this bound is sharp.

**Definitions.**

- \( \chi \): Euler characteristic of the Calabi–Yau threefold, defined as \( \chi = 2(h^{1,1} - h^{2,1}) \).
- \( \chi_{\text{density}} \): Euler density, computed as \( \chi_{\text{density}} = \chi / \text{config\_sum} \), where config_sum is the total sum of the configuration matrix entries.

- $p$: the number of defining polynomials (codimension),

- $a$: the ambient dimension of the configuration matrix (i.e., number of rows),

- $k$: the number of nonzero entries in the configuration matrix.

**Interpretation.**
This conjecture relates topological data (\( \chi \)) to the algebraic sparsity of the defining configuration. It asserts that a sparse polynomial description of the manifold forces the Euler characteristic, scaled by matrix complexity, to remain above a threshold — signaling a kind of minimal topological complexity in sparse embeddings.
