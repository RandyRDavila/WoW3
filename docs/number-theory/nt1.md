# Conjecture NT.1 — Primes in Totient-Based Sets vs Digit Sums

**Statement.**
For any positive integer \( n \), the number of primes in the digit-sum neighborhood of \( n \) satisfies:

$$
\pi\left( N_{\sum}^+(n) \right) \geq 2 \cdot \pi\left( N_{\varphi}^+(n) \right) - 5
$$

**Definitions.**

- \( \pi(A) \): Number of primes in the set \( A \).
- \( N_f^+(n) = \{ m \leq n : m = k + f(k) \text{ for some } k \} \): *additive functional neighborhood*.
- \( \sum(n) \): Sum of the digits of \( n \).
- \( \varphi(n) \): Euler’s totient function — number of integers up to \( n \) that are coprime with \( n \).

**Interpretation.**
This conjecture suggests that digit-related neighborhoods of \( n \) contain significantly more primes than those defined by totients. Empirically, equality holds for 16 instances.
