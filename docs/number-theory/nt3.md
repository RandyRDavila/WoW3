# Conjecture NT.14 â€” Prime Digits Imply Average Bounds

**Statement.**
For any positive integer \( n \), if all digits of \( n \) are prime, then:

$$
\text{avg}(\text{digits}(n)) \geq \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sum(\text{digits}(n))
$$

**Definitions.**

- A digit is *prime* if it belongs to the set {2, 3, 5, 7}.
- \( \sum(\text{digits}(n)) \): The sum of the digits of \( n \).
- \( \text{avg}(\text{digits}(n)) \): The average of the digits of \( n \), i.e., sum divided by number of digits.

**Interpretation.**
This conjecture implies that numbers composed entirely of prime digits must have relatively balanced and large digit values, ensuring that their average is a large fraction of their total digit sum.
