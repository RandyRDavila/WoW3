## Upper Bound on Domination in Terms of Slater

---

### Statement

**Conjecture.** Let $k = sl(G)$. If $G$ is a connected graph, then
$$
\gamma(G) \le sl_k(G),
$$
and this bound is sharp.

### Definitions

- A graph is **connected** if there is a path between every pair of vertices.

- The $k$-**slater** number of a graph $G$ is defined as:
  $sl_k(G) = \min \{t :  t + \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i}^t d_i \ge n(G) \}$, where $d_n, d_{n-1}, \dots, d_1$ are the vertex degrees of $G$ written in nonincreasing order.

- The **domination number** of a graph $G$, denoted $\gamma(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set of vertices in $G$.

### Equality Cases

Equality is attained on **7** graphs in the known dataset.
