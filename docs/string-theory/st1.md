# Conjecture ST.1 — Hodge Ratio Bound Predicts Sparse Configurations

**Statement.**
If the ratio of Hodge numbers satisfies

$$
\frac{h^{2,1}}{h^{1,1}} < \frac{38}{11} \cdot \max_{i,j} c_{ij},
$$

then the configuration matrix is sparse.

**Definitions.**

- \( h^{1,1} \), \( h^{2,1} \): Hodge numbers of the Calabi–Yau threefold, representing the dimensions of the Kähler and complex structure moduli spaces, respectively.
- \( \max_{i,j} c_{ij} \): The largest entry in the configuration matrix \( C = [c_{ij}] \), which encodes the defining polynomials of the complete intersection Calabi–Yau (CICY) manifold.
- `is_sparse_config`: A Boolean indicator that is true if the configuration matrix has a low number of nonzero entries relative to its size, suggesting algebraic simplicity or degeneracy.

**Interpretation.**
This conjecture posits a nonlinear relationship between geometric complexity and topological asymmetry. When the Hodge structure is unbalanced in favor of complex structure moduli, but this imbalance is not too large relative to the maximum polynomial degree, the defining data tends to be sparse. This reflects a possible geometric signal for detecting algebraically minimal embeddings.
