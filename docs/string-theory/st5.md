# Conjecture ST.5 — Mirror Symmetry Implies Entry Bound from Total Moduli

**Statement.**
If a Calabi–Yau threefold is **mirror symmetric**, then

$$
\max_{i,j}c_{ij} \geq -\frac{1}{30}\cdot(h^{1,1} + h^{2,1}) + 2,
$$

and this bound is sharp.

> **Status:** <span class="badge status-open">Open</span>

**Definitions.**

- \( h^{1,1} \), \( h^{2,1} \): Hodge numbers of the manifold.
- \( h_{\text{sum}} = h^{1,1} + h^{2,1} \): Total number of moduli.
- \( c_{ij} \): Entry in the configuration matrix.
- \( \max_{i,j} c_{ij} \): Maximum entry in the configuration matrix.
- `is_mirror_symmetric`: True if the manifold is mirror symmetric (i.e., it is self-mirror or has a known mirror partner with exchanged Hodge numbers).

**Interpretation.**
This inequality links mirror symmetry with constraints on the degree structure of the configuration matrix. It suggests that self-duality in the moduli space imposes a soft upper bound on the “simplicity” of defining equations.
