# Written on the Wall III (WoW3)

**WoW3** is the official research site of Randy Davila. It serves as a living archive of mathematical conjectures generated by the automated conjecturing system *TxGraffiti* (short for *Texas Graffiti*) and its descendants.

The name *Written on the Wall* pays homage to earlier collections of machine-generated conjectures from the original Graffiti (WoW I) and Graffiti.pc (WoW II) systems. **WoW3** continues this legacy by presenting a curated library of both *open* and *resolved* conjectures produced through symbolic reasoning, optimization, and creative heuristics.

## ðŸ¤– What is TxGraffiti?

*TxGraffiti* is an automated conjecturing engine built to explore relationships between mathematical invariants. It combines:

- mixed-integer programming,
- convex geometry,
- data-driven heuristics,
- and symbolic pattern recognition.

The system formulates and refines mathematical statementsâ€”many of which remain open, surprising, and of independent mathematical interest.

## ðŸ“š What Youâ€™ll Find Here

This site contains:

- Open conjectures awaiting proof or counterexample
- Resolved conjectures with proofs or disproofs
- Metadata on each conjecture (e.g., equality cases, sharpness, known witnesses)
- Collections organized by topic (e.g., graph theory, string theory)
- Lean formalizations and interactive visualizations (when available)
- My CV and complete publication list

## ðŸ§  A Dialogue with a Machine

WoW3 invites mathematicians, students, and AI researchers to explore the frontiers of automated discovery. Each conjecture is a potential theoremâ€”and a glimpse into how machines reason symbolically. The goal is not just to solve, but to reflect on what it means for machines to participate in creative mathematical thought.
