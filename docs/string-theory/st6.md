# Conjecture ST.6 — Manifold Geometries Require Multiple Projective Factors

**Statement.**
If a Calabi–Yau manifold lies at a conifold point in the moduli space, then the maximum entry in its configuration matrix satisfies the inequality:

$$
\max_{i,j}c_{ij}\geq \frac{1}{9} \cdot n,
$$

and this bound is sharp

> **Status:** <span class="badge status-open">Open</span>

**Definitions.**

- `max_entry`: The largest integer \( c_{ij} \) appearing in the configuration matrix of the Calabi–Yau.
- \( n \): The number of ambient projective space factors (i.e., the number of columns in \( C \)).
- `is_conifold_point`: True if the configuration corresponds to a known conifold transition in the CICY landscape.

**Interpretation.**
This inequality suggests that Calabi–Yau threefolds near conifold transitions require a certain amount of local structural complexity — reflected in higher individual matrix entries — as the number of ambient projective factors increases. It implies a geometric cost to embedding singularities of this kind in lower-dimensional or simpler ambient spaces.
