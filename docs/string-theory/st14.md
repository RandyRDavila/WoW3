# Conjecture ST.14 — Dominant Hodge Number Lower Bound via Moduli Density

**Statement.**
For any Calabi–Yau threefold manifold,

$$
\max(h^{1,1}, h^{2,1}) \geq 6 \cdot \dfrac{h^{1,1} + h^{2,1}}{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{ij}}
$$

**Definitions.**

- \( h^{1,1}, h^{2,1} \): Hodge numbers of the Calabi–Yau threefold.
- \( \text{moduli\_density} = \dfrac{h^{1,1} + h^{2,1}}{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{ij}} \): Moduli per unit configuration size.

**Interpretation.**
This conjecture posits that having a high density of deformation moduli (relative to the configuration size) necessitates a high value for at least one of the Hodge numbers. In other words, the complexity of the manifold’s shape, as captured by its moduli, cannot be densely packed unless the geometry itself is sufficiently rich in cohomology.
