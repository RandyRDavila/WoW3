# Conjecture NT.2 â€” Distance to Nearest Prime Bounded by Prime Divisor Count

**Statement.**
For any positive integer \( n \), the distance to the nearest prime is bounded by a constant relative to the number of distinct prime divisors:

$$
|F(n) - \omega(n)| \leq C
$$

for some universal constant \( C > 0 \).

**Definitions.**

- \( F(n) \): Distance from \( n \) to the nearest prime.
- \( \omega(n) \): Number of distinct prime divisors of \( n \).

**Interpretation.**
This conjecture proposes a bounded relationship between the arithmetic and multiplicative structure of integers. It implies a predictable balance between how far a number is from primality and how rich its prime factorization is.
