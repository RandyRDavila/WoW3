### Definitions

- A graph is **connected** if there is a path between every pair of vertices.

- The **energy** of a graph $G$, denoted $E(G)$, is the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix, rounded to the nearest integer:
  $$
  E(G) = \sum_{i=1}^n |\lambda_i|, \quad \text{rounded to nearest integer}
  $$
  where $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n$ are the eigenvalues of $A(G)$.

- The **triameter** of a graph $G$, denoted $\operatorname{tri}(G)$, is defined as:
  $$
  \operatorname{tri}(G) = \max \{ d(u,v) + d(v,w) + d(u,w) : u,v,w \in V(G) \},
  $$
  where $d(u,v)$ is the length of the shortest path between $u$ and $v$ in $G$.
